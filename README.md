This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, which attempts to parse a user ID as an integer without checking its validity.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior if a non-numeric ID is passed. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.
